# Selected projects in data science, machine learning and AI

**Improving interview preparation with an AI-powered assistant built on large language models**

Inspired by the challenges many face when preparing for data science interviews, we created LiA to help job seekers better prepare for technical interviews. Motivated by our own experiences entering the data science field, we built an AI-powered tool that dynamically generates personalized interview questions, simulates mock interviews, and provides feedback. LiA leverages large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is fully deployed on Google Cloud to deliver a seamless, interactive experience.

**Modeling chronic illness through synthetic data: A research study on diabetes management and analytics**

In this project, my team and I conducted a research study on diabetes using a fully synthetic patient challenges around healthcare privacy and limited data availability. We simulated realistic health metrics for 10,000 individuals over 90 days, including blood glucose levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, and insulin dosage. By applying descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we uncovered trends in disease progression, modeled anomalies, and generated actionable insights to inform personalized diabetes care.
